Introduction to Expo
Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
Quick start
If you are already experienced with React and JavaScript tooling and want to dive right in and figure things out as you go, this is the quickest way to get started:
npm install --global expo-cli

expo init my-project
Slow start
Follow us through a choose-your-own-adventure learning journey and we'll teach you how to get oriented in the Expo and React Native ecosystems and write your first app.

Initializing the project
